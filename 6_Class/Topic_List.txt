--------------Data Structure In Python---------------
1. List 
----- Access list(indexing,negative indexing, Range indexing)
----- Add(append, insert, Extend)
----- Change list(indexing, Range, insert)
----- Remove(remove, pop indexing, pop, del indexing, clear), 
----- loop(for, while)
----- sort(ascending, descending, key, reverse)
----- copy(list keyword, slice :)
----- join(operator +, append, extend)
----- list Comprehension
----- count


---------------- Problems -----------------
1. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.

2. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list.

3. Write a Python program to count the number of strings from a given list of strings. The string length is 2 or more and the first and last characters are the same.
Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
Expected Result : 2

4. Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member. 
ex: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  Result/output = True
ex: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]     Result/output = False

5. Write a Python program to find the list of words that are longer than n from a given list of words.
ex: n = 4 string = "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text"
output: ["Lorem", "Ipsum", "simply", "dummy"]
